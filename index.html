      Welcome to my personal website!
      </h1>
      <h3 style='clear:both'; class="subhead">
      <p>My name is Daniel and I am a 4th year MEng Spacecraft Engineering Student. Spaceflight has always captured my imagination, and I have developed a passion for it, which is why I chose to become an aerospace engineer.</p>
      <p>I am an ambitious and self-motivated person, driven by curiosity. My career goal is to join the space industry and become a propulsion engineer.</p>
      <p>I will use this website to showcase and share projects alongside other things. (This site is a constant work in progress!)</p>

      <div class="img_right">
        <h2 class="project_title">Sirius Bipropellant Rocket Engine</h2>
        <img style="border-radius: 5px" src="./images/sirius.jpg" alt="Sirius">
        <p>Project Sirius is a student led project that aims to design and build a cost-effective, three stage rocket to launch small satellites into low Earth orbit from a UK based spaceport.
        </p>
        
        <p>The current stage of the project involves the design, manufacture and testing of a 1.5kN regeneratively cooled 3D printed liquid fuel engine. The project aims to serve as a testbed to develop a new generation of “green” propellant rocket propulsion.
        </p>

        <h2 class="project_title">Scientific CubeSat Concept Study</h2>
        <img style="border-radius: 5px" src="./images/cubesatcut.png" alt="CubeSat">
        <p>This project consisted in the conceptual design of a 2U CubeSat mission aimed at measuring the concentration of CO2 in the thermosphere. The development was carried out following a concurrent design approach.</p>
        
        <p>The proposed spacecraft is also a technology demonstrator for the use of deployable solar arrays for passive attitude bias, SLS 3D printing for the primary structure and shape memory alloys in deployment mechanisms.
        </p>

      <div class="img_right">
        <h2 class="project_title">Miniaturised Infrared Radiometer</h2>
        <img style="border-radius: 5px" src="./images/radiometer.png" alt="Radiometer">
        <p>This project involved the design of a scientific instrument: a miniaturized infrared (IR) radiometer designed to measure net thermal radiative flux inside Venus' atmosphere. 
        </p>
        <p>This instrument has a minimal number of components: a thermopile sensor, a calibration source, and a MEMS light switch. The MEMS device can either reflect external atmospheric light into the sensor, or steer radiation from the calibration target into the sensor. Providing in-situ reference readings to calibrate the mirror while it descends through the atmosphere, correcting any measurement drifts.</p>

      <div class="img_left">
        <h2 class="project_title">Fixed Wing UAV</h2>
        <img style="border-radius: 5px" src="./images/uav2.jpeg" alt="UAV">
        <p>This project comprised the design, manufacture and testing of a 1.8 m wingspan UAV. We had to face the challenges involved when dealing with tight mass, volume, time and cost budgets.</p>
        <p>We were able to design and build a machine that can fly beautifully while recording lots of telemetry & payload data to serve very different missions.</p>
