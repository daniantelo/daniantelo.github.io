				<p>My name is Daniel. I am a space propulsion engineer. Spaceflight has always captured my imagination, and I have developed a passion for it, which is why I chose to follow this path.</p>


				<p>I am an ambitious and self-motivated person, driven by curiosity. My career goal is to become a launcher propulsion engineer.</p>

					<img alt="Sirius" src="./images/sirius.jpg" style="border-radius: 5px">

					<p>Project Sirius is a student led project that aims to design and build a cost-effective, three stage rocket to launch small satellites into low Earth orbit from a UK based spaceport.</p>


					<p>The current stage of the project involves the design, manufacture and testing of a 1.5kN regeneratively cooled 3D printed liquid fuel engine. The project aims to serve as a testbed to develop a new generation of “green” propellant rocket propulsion.</p>

					<img alt="CubeSat" src="./images/cubesatcut6.png" style="border-radius: 5px">

					<p>This project consisted in the conceptual design of a 2U CubeSat mission aimed at measuring the concentration of CO2 in the thermosphere. The development was carried out following a concurrent design approach.</p>


					<p>The proposed spacecraft is also a technology demonstrator for the use of deployable solar arrays for passive attitude bias, SLS 3D printing for the primary structure and shape memory alloys in deployment mechanisms.</p>

					<a href="./projects/project_radiometer/project_radiometer.html"><h2 class="project_title"><strong>Miniaturised Infrared Radiometer</strong></h2></a>
					<img alt="Radiometer" src="./images/radiometer.png" style="border-radius: 5px">

					<p>This project involved the design of a scientific instrument: a miniaturized infrared (IR) radiometer designed to measure net thermal radiative flux inside Venus' atmosphere.</p>


					<p>This instrument has a minimal number of components: a thermopile sensor, a calibration source, and a MEMS light switch. The MEMS device can either reflect external atmospheric light into the sensor, or steer radiation from the calibration target into the sensor. Providing in-situ reference readings to calibrate the mirror while it descends through the atmosphere, correcting any measurement drifts.</p>

					<a href="./projects/project_uav/project_uav.html"><h2 class="project_title"><strong>Fixed Wing UAV</strong></h2></a>
					<img alt="UAV" src="./images/uav2.jpeg" style="border-radius: 5px">

					<p>This project comprised the design, manufacture and testing of a 1.8 m wingspan UAV. We had to face the challenges involved when dealing with tight mass, volume, time and cost budgets.</p>


					<p>We were able to design and build a machine that can fly beautifully while recording lots of telemetry & payload data to serve very different missions.</p>
