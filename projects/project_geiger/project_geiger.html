					<img alt="UAV" src="../../images/geiger.jpeg" style="border-radius: 5px">

					<p>I've always wanted to have my very own Geiger-Müller counter to test radioactive samples, but the price of profesional grade equipment is too high to justify the cost for a "toy". Instead, I decided to build it myself using readily available consumer parts.</p>


					<p>The device only employs four parts: the Geiger-Müller tube driver circuit, the tube itself, the Arduino microcontroller, and a portable 5V USB battery. It features a data logging function.</p>
				</div>

				<p>Geiger-Müller tubes work by applying a high voltage (between 300-600 Volts usually) between to electrodes on opposite ends of a sealed tube filled with an inert gas. When radiation collides with the tube, it briefly ionises the gas, creating a pulse-current between the electrodes.</p>

				<p>The driver circuit applies this high voltage and senses these pulses, converting them into signals. The circuit that I used is a readily available kit manufactured by RH Electronics. It can accomodate various types of GM tubes, and is able to output pulses conditioned for microcontrollers like an Arduino. It also features a built in buzzer attached to the output.</p>

					<p>The tube employed is an SBM-20, produced in mass in the USSR during the Cold War. They are the quintesencial DIY GM counter tube, and are very robust and reliable, with good beta and gamma detection; Useless for alpha detection however. They are readily available online and are not expensive.</p>

					<p>The tests I've carried out have shown an average background of 23 CPM, which seems to correlate with the measurements shared by other users online. I haven't had the chance to test it with a highly source up to this date. The only radioactive sample that I've tried with it is a thoriated tungsten filament used for TIG welding. It has a very low Thorium content of only 2%, and it itself decays via alpha emission, so what the GM tube records is the beta emissions from its decay products, mainly Radon.</p>
				</div>

				<p>The Arduino code records the pulses by using interrupts. These pulses are counted for periods of one minute and then written onto a csv file that allows them to be post processed. </p>
