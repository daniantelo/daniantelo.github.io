					<img alt="Sirius" src="../images/sirius.jpg" style="border-radius: 5px">

					<p>Project Sirius is a student led project that aims to design and build a cost-effective, three stage rocket to launch small satellites into low Earth orbit from a UK based spaceport.</p>


					<p>The current stage of the project involves the design, manufacture and testing of a 1.5kN regeneratively cooled 3D printed liquid fuel engine. The project aims to serve as a testbed to develop a new generation of “green” propellant rocket propulsion.</p>

					<img alt="CubeSat" src="../images/cubesatcut6.png" style="border-radius: 5px">

					<p>This project consisted in the conceptual design of a 2U CubeSat mission aimed at measuring the concentration of CO2 in the thermosphere. The development was carried out following a concurrent design approach.</p>


					<p>The proposed spacecraft is also a technology demonstrator for the use of deployable solar arrays for passive attitude bias, SLS 3D printing for the primary structure and shape memory alloys in deployment mechanisms.</p>

					<a href="./project_radiometer/project_radiometer.html"><h2 class="project_title">Miniaturised Infrared Radiometer</h2></a>
					<img alt="Radiometer" src="../images/radiometer.png" style="border-radius: 5px">

					<p>This project involved the design of a scientific instrument: a miniaturized infrared (IR) radiometer designed to measure net thermal radiative flux inside Venus' atmosphere.</p>


					<p>This instrument has a minimal number of components: a thermopile sensor, a calibration source, and a MEMS light switch. The MEMS device can either reflect external atmospheric light into the sensor, or steer radiation from the calibration target into the sensor. Providing in-situ reference readings to calibrate the mirror while it descends through the atmosphere, correcting any measurement drifts.</p>

					<a href="./project_uav/project_uav.html"><h2 class="project_title">Fixed Wing UAV</h2></a>
					<img alt="UAV" src="../images/uav2.jpeg" style="border-radius: 5px">

					<p>This project comprised the design, manufacture and testing of a 1.8 m wingspan UAV. We had to face the challenges involved when dealing with tight mass, volume, time and cost budgets.</p>


					<p>We were able to design and build a machine that can fly beautifully while recording lots of telemetry & payload data to serve very different missions.</p>

					<img alt="Sirius" src="../images/faceshieldsproduction.jpeg" style="border-radius: 5px">

					<p>During the Covid-19 pandemic, which badly affected Spain, I joined a local initiative to produce and distribute 3D-Printed face shields to help essential public workers protect themselves during nationwide lockdown.</p>


					<p>Individually, I produced and delivered over 60 face shields to a diverse range of public services among which I can name the Spanish National Police, the local Ambulance Service and the Spanish Red Cross.</p>

					<a href="./project_geiger/project_geiger.html"><h2 class="project_title">Arduino Geiger Muller Counter</h2></a>
					<img alt="UAV" src="../images/geiger.jpeg" style="border-radius: 5px">

					<p>I've always wanted to have my very own Geiger-Müller counter to test radioactive samples, but the price of profesional grade equipment is too high to justify the cost for a "toy". Instead, I decided to build it myself using readily available consumer parts.</p>


					<p>The device only employs four parts: the Geiger-Müller tube driver circuit, the tube itself, the Arduino microcontroller, and a portable 5V USB battery. It features a data logging function.</p>
